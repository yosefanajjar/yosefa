In this post I’ll walk you through how I built my discord bot, this should give
you a jump start into building your own bot and build on top of it to add more
functionality if you’d like. Here is the link to the Github repo of the
[project](https://github.com/yosefanajjar/wise-man-bot) as you may prefer to
follow the full code while reading this post.

To get started we’ll need to create a discord app in the
[discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). The bot
I built listens to commands or interactions and responds with a random quote, I
called it WiseMan. When you create the bot in the portal, you’ll need to keep
these two values to authenticate requests from the discord API to your bot

Now we’ll need to build the app, you can choose the backend technology you are
most comfortable with for this one I’ll use ExpressJS for our bot’s API and
we’ll use TypeScript because I love types!

### Creating the project

If you have project already running or know how to create a starter project with
Express and TypeScript then you can skip this step

Let’s initialise the project by creating a new folder and initialise an npm
package

```jsx
mdkir wise-man-bot && cd wise-man-bot && pnpm init -y
```

Next up we’ll need to install express and dotenv (for accessing our env
variables)

```jsx
pnpm express dotenv
```

Now let’s add typescript to the project

```jsx
pnpm i -D typescript @types/express @types/node
```

We’ll need to generate tsconfig file as well

```jsx
npx tsc --init
```

In the tsconfig specify a dist folder as our output for the typescript complier

```jsx
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "outDir": "./dist"
    ...
  }
}
```

### The project structure

Let’s define the project files structure, create the following `src` folder with
these files/

```jsx
/src
- commands.ts // Used for keeping the slash commands and registering them
- index.ts // The main file which will serve the endpoints of our server
- utils.ts // Used for the discord util functions
```

In **commnds.ts** we’ll add our slash commands, the slash command consists of a
name and description of the command, there are other properties and options that
you can specify but for simplicity we’ll just define it with a name and
description

```tsx
const GET_QUOTE_COMMAND: Command = {
  name: 'quote',
  description: 'Get a random quote from the wise man',
}
```

We defined our first slash command to get the a quote from the bot, I’m using
custom types for now but if you want more official types from discord that are
currently in progress check out **discord-api-types**

Next up we’ll need to register our slash command and to do that we’ll need to
make a call to the discord API so let’s write down the function that will do
discord requests

```tsx
// utils.ts
export const DiscordRequest = async (
  endpoint: string,
  options: DiscordRequestOptions,
): Promise<globalThis.Response> => {
  // append endpoint to root API URL
  const url = 'https://discord.com/api/v10/' + endpoint
  // Use node-fetch to make requests
  const res = await fetch(url, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bot ${process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
      'User-Agent':
        'WiseManBot (https://github.com/yosefanajjar/wise-man-bot, 1.0.0)',
    },
    ...options,
  })
  // throw API errors
  if (!res.ok) {
    const data = await res.json()
    console.log(res.status)
    throw new Error(JSON.stringify(data))
  }
  // return original response
  return res
}
```

The function above will take a discord api endpoint and the options which will
contain the api call method and the body containing the data we want to send I’m
using node fetch as per the example in the discord docs but you can use
something else like axios I don’t think that should be a problem.

Notice for interacting with the discord api we’ll need your discord app’s token
which you can get the value for from the developer portal, copy the token and
add it to your .env

![Bot Token Generation](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/bot-token.png)

Your .env file should look something like this

```tsx
APP_ID=
DISCORD_TOKEN=
PUBLIC_KEY=
```

I’ve added the function below to make the API call to register/install the slash
commands, now we can call this function in our commands.ts file

```tsx
// utils.ts
export const InstallGlobalCommands = async (
  appId: string | undefined,
  commands: Command[],
): Promise<void> => {
  // API endpoint to overwrite global commands
  const endpoint = `applications/${appId}/commands`

  try {
    // This is calling the bulk overwrite endpoint: https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#bulk-overwrite-global-application-commands
    await DiscordRequest(endpoint, {
      method: 'PUT',
      body: JSON.stringify(commands), // Stringify payloads
    })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}
```

```tsx
// commands.ts
import 'dotenv/config'
import { InstallGlobalCommands } from './utils.js'
import { type Command } from './types/index.js'

const GET_QUOTE_COMMAND: Command = {
  name: 'quote',
  description: 'Get a random quote from the wise man',
}

export const ALL_COMMANDS: Command[] = [GET_QUOTE_COMMAND]

void (async () => {
  await InstallGlobalCommands(process.env.APP_ID, ALL_COMMANDS)
})()
```

To run this command let’s add a register script to our package.json to run this
file. I’m using tsx to run the typscripts file in real time, it’s a modern
version of ts-node

```tsx
// package.json
"scripts": {
	"register": "tsx src/commands.ts",
	...
}
```

Now that we’ve got our command register it’s time to write the endpoint that
will receive the interaction from the discord api and respond to it. But before
adding the endpoint we need to make sure that we verify the requests are coming
from the discord api and for that we’ll use the
**[discord-interactions](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js)**
package for verification and to handle signature headers

```tsx
// utils.ts
export function VerifyDiscordRequest(clientKey: string) {
  return function (req: Request, res: Response, buf: Buffer, encoding: string) {
    const signature = req.get('X-Signature-Ed25519') as Signature
    const timestamp = req.get('X-Signature-Timestamp') as Signature

    const isValidRequest = verifyKey(buf, signature, timestamp, clientKey)
    if (!isValidRequest) {
      res.status(401).send('Bad request signature')
      throw new Error('Bad request signature')
    }
  }
}
```

The function above uses the verifyKey function from discord-interactions to
verify the api request, we’ll use this function in a middleware that will run
before every request. It’s important to place this middleware before any body
parsing that you do with packages like body-parser because we want to pass the
function above the raw body

```tsx
// Parse request body and verifies incoming requests using discord-interactions package
app.use(express.json({ verify: VerifyDiscordRequest(process.env.PUBLIC_KEY) }))
```

After adding the middleware we can define the interactions endpoint that discord
will send requests to, the endpoint must be prepared to acknowledge
a `PING` message and handle the slash commands you’ve registered

```tsx
app.post(
  '/interactions',
  async (req, res): Promise<InteractionsApiResponse | void> => {
    // Interaction type and data
    const { type, data } = req.body

    /**
     * Handle verification requests
     */
    if (type === InteractionType.PING) {
      return res.send({ type: InteractionResponseType.PONG })
    }

    /**
     * Handle slash command requests
     * See https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#slash-commands
     */
    if (type === InteractionType.APPLICATION_COMMAND) {
      const { name } = data

      if (name === 'quote') {
        const quote = await quoteOfTheDay() // makes an api call to get random quote
        // Send a message into the channel where command was triggered from
        return res.send({
          type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
          data: {
            content: quote,
          },
        })
      }
    }
  },
)
```

### Deploying your API

Time to deploy the server, but before deploying let’s make sure we’ve got all
the needed scripts in our package.json

```tsx
"scripts": {
    "build": "npx tsc", // compiles ts code and outputs to /dist
    "start": "node dist/index.js", // starts local server of compiled code
    "register": "tsx src/commands.ts", // registers the slash commands
    "dev": "nodemon - exec 'tsx' src/index.ts" // runs local dev server
  },
```

We’ll need to deploy the app to get a url of our interactions endpoint to give
to the discord app in the developer portal, you can deploy to test things
quickly using a tool like **ngrock** I’ll deploy the api on R**ender** they
provide an interface that makes it easy to deploy an API

Connect Render with your Github repo and update the settings for the build and
run commands since we’re using typescript for our project. You’ll also need to
provide values for the environment variables we’ve added under
the \***\*Environment\*\*** tab

![Render Settings](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/render-settings.png)

Once we deploy successfully and get a URL let’s go add it to our discord bot

![Discord Interactions Url](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/discord-interactions-url.png)

Save your changes and to go test the app we need to generate a url to add the
bot to a server where we can test the commands, go to the OAuth2 tab under URL
Generator we need to specify the permissions needed for our bot to respond to
slash commands. Select the permissions below and add the bot to the server of
your choice

![Bot Generate URL](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/bot-generate-url.png)

After adding the bot to a server you’ll see the slash commands our bot can
execute and running it should give us a random quote as we planned

![Bot Slash Command](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/bot-slash-command.png)

![Bot Slash Command Execution](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/bot-slash-command-execution.png)

### Common Issues

- You might run into issues when running the slash commands if your bot was
  inactive for more than 30 minutes and that’s due to cold starts and the
  discord api has a timeout so it’s likely to fail. The free plan on Render will
  make your API go to sleep if you are not using it, the solution to that is to
  upgrade your plan or you can use another provider like AWS
  ![Bot Slash Command Failure](/images/building-a-discord-bot-with-interactions/bot-slash-command-failure.png)
- Signature size error: you’ll get this error if you are not verifying the
  discord calls correctly, make sure that your middleware is receiving the raw
  body and test the api endpoint by executing the command in the discord app, as
  in Postman you won’t have the correct values for the signature headers
