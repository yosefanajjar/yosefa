  How to build a design system in React. In This blog post I go through
  implementing a design system from a Figma design in code with React and Styled
  Components. You can apply the same steps with other technologies

**Design systems** are used in a popular way to define the style guide and the
components that form applications, I am not a designer so I don’t feel I will
explain what a design system is in the best possible way so if you wish to know
more
[visit](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969)
this article. The bottom of the line is that they are helpful for the team to
understand and develop the application and more importantly to have a more
consistent UI in both the design and code.

In this guide, I am going to be using a pre-made design system template from the
Figma community
[click here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/867135839870202854) to view.
The image below is the style guide for our simple design system that we will be
implementing in code later.

![Design System In Figma](/images/building-a-design-system/figma.png)

## ⚡Let's write some code!

So let's just get right into it, what we are going to do is setting up a style
guide in code for the team to follow when they are building UIs and components.
We will be building/implementing the design system in code using **React**,
**Styled Components**, and **Styled System**.

By now I assume you already have a React app ready to work with if not create a
new react app and call it whatever name you like.

```bash
npx create-react-app react-design-system
```

### Installing Our Tools

We need to install styled-components and styled-system:

**[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)**: is a CSS in JS solution
and personally my favorite way of writing CSS

**[Styled System](https://styled-system.com/)**: is a collection of utility
functions that add style props to your React components and allows you to
control styles based on a global theme object with typographic scales, colors,
and layout properties. And it works with both Styled Components + EmotionJS.

```bash
yarn add styled-components styled-system
```

### Setting Up Our Theme:

In this first step, we are going to set up the global theme for our app from the
Figma design system, our theme consists of colors, fonts and their sizes,
spacing, and breakpoints (for responsive design). I'm going to be setting up
those right from the Figma template so use it as a reference and I will try to
mention where you can find each section wherever I can.

Basically, we are going to create a global theme object that can be easily used
in other places.

**Adding colors**:

Figma reference: style guide page ⇒ color scheme frame.

```jsx
export default {
  colors: {
    primary: '#ED4B9E',
    secondary: '#4B4DED',
    tertiary: '#F3D9DA',
    dark: '#0E0E2C',
    success: '#31D0AA',
    text: '#4A4A68',
    subtleText: '#8C8CA1',
    accent: '#ECF1F4',
    light: '#FAFCFE',
    white: '#FFFFFF',
  },
}
```

It's very simple just adding a colors object to our theme where the color name
is the key and the value is the hex color value and now we have added all of our
colors.

**Adding font sizes**:

Figma reference: style guide page ⇒ type scale frame.

Simply we need to add all the font sizes that are used in the Figma and there
are multiple ways of doing it, but here is what we will do, following the styled
system's [theme specification](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification) we
will create an array that contains all the sizes from the smallest to the
largest and then we are gonna add properties to that array and I will explain
why later, just keep it in mind for now:

```jsx
const fontSizes = ['10px', '12px', '14px', '16px', '24px', '40px', '64px']

fontSizes.extraSmall = fontSizes[0]
fontSizes.smaller = fontSizes[1]
fontSizes.small = fontSizes[2]
fontSizes.medium = fontSizes[3]
fontSizes.large = fontSizes[4]
fontSizes.larger = fontSizes[5]
fontSizes.extraLarge = fontSizes[6]
```

We can add the `fontSizes` object to our theme. but before let's also handle the
spacing and breakpoints in the same way.

```jsx
const breakpoints = ['600px', '900px', '1200px', '1800px']

breakpoints.sm = breakpoints[0]
breakpoints.md = breakpoints[1]
breakpoints.lg = breakpoints[2]
breakpoints.xl = breakpoints[3]

const spaces = ['4px', '8px', '16px', '32px', '48px', '56px']

spaces.smaller = spaces[0]
spaces.small = spaces[1]
spaces.medium = spaces[2]
spaces.large = spaces[3]
spaces.larger = spaces[4]
spaces.extraLarge = spaces[5]
```

Now! let's add them all to our theme object and we should have an exported
object that looks like this:

```jsx
export default {
  colors: {
    primary: '#ED4B9E',
    secondary: '#4B4DED',
    tertiary: '#F3D9DA',
    dark: '#0E0E2C',
    success: '#31D0AA',
    text: '#4A4A68',
    subtleText: '#8C8CA1',
    accent: '#ECF1F4',
    light: '#FAFCFE',
    white: '#FFFFFF',
  },
  fontSizes,
  breakpoints,
  spaces,
}
```

And it has all of what we need to start developing our UI but first, we need to
learn how to use it so let's do that in the next step.

### Using the theme:

In the `app.js` file import `ThemeProvider` from styled-components and import
our `theme` object that we've just created.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'

import theme from './utils/theme'
```

Then let's wrap our app component's children with that `ThemeProvider`, and that
doesn't mean now we are using our theme yet but it means our theme is available
for our components to use and will explain next how we can use this theme in
multiple ways using both styled-components and styled system.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <div>Hello World</div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

There are different ways of accessing this theme's values but I will mention the
two ways I am using in this guide:

**In styled components:** we can access the theme values using the props
function

```jsx
const Component = styled.div`
  color: ${props => props.theme.colors.dark};
`
```

**In styled system:** as we are using it to add utility functions that add style
props to our component, it will also be using our theme so that we can pass
theme values directly to those props. I know this may seem a bit confusing but I
hope the following example illustrates what I was trying to explain.

```jsx
import { color } from 'styled-system';

const Component = styled.div`
	${color};
`
<Component color="dark" />
```

the `dark` color will be fetched from our theme and if there is no such color
then it will fall back to the original CSS value of that color.

If you wish to learn more on the `ThemeProvier` check the styled-components docs
[here](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider).

### Creating the layout:

The general layout component is also in the Figma which explains how the content
is displayed in pages but ours is just simple, it's only defining the padding on
the sides.

On desktop we need a padding of `32px` (`spaces[3]` or `spaces.large` from our
theme) on the sides and on mobile, we need only `16px` (`spaces[2]` or
`spaces.medium` from our theme). Here is how we will do it:

Creating a `Wrapper` component with _styled-components_ and then add the `space`
utilities to it from _styled-system_ which will allow us to use the `padding` or
`p` prop and even more for this Wrapper component.

```jsx
import { space } from 'styled-system'

const Wrapper = styled.div`
  ${space};
`
```

Then we will create our layout component that will receive children and wrap it
in our `Wrapper` component and to achieve the layout we need we can do in
different ways, _Styled System_ offers a convenient shorthand syntax for writing
responsive styles with a mobile-first approach and there are two ways to do it
which is using **Arrays** or using **Objects**.

My favorite and I think is easier is by **Using Objects**:

it works by passing an object to the prop that contains each breakpoint as a key
and the value for that breakpoint as a number, and both of these values will be
resolved from our theme but let's take a look at the code first after I will
explain in more detail.

```jsx
export const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Wrapper padding={{ default: 3, sm: 4 }}>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </Wrapper>
  )
}
```

In our Layout component we are using the object syntax and let's break it down,
as I said it's a mobile-first approach so:

- The `default` property is going to be the starting point and the value it
  takes is `3` which resolves to the value of `16px` from our theme.

**Side Note**: the number `3` is not the index of the value in the array, think
of it as the `index + 1` of that value

- The `sm` property is our first breakpoint `600px` and its value is `2` which
  resolves to `32px` and this means starting from the width of 600px use 32px of
  padding exactly like this media query `media (min-width: 600px)`

If you wish to know more on responsive design using styled-system check the docs
[here](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles)

**Adding Fonts**

We need to add our fonts that we are using in the Figma, the way I like to do it
is by downloading the fonts and then adding them to our `fonts` folder so let's
do that first:

```jsx
--/fonts
	|-- WorkSans-Bold.ttf
  |-- WorkSans-Medium.ttf
```

Then we will need to add these fonts to our app so that we can actually use
them. Create an `index.js` file in the same fonts directory above and import the
`createGlobalStyle` function from styled-components also don't forget to import
your fonts.

```jsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components'

import WorkSansMediumTTF from './WorkSans-Medium.ttf'
import WorkSansBoldTTF from './WorkSans-Bold.ttf'
```

Next, is to add the font-face for these fonts and exporting the component,
notice that we are using the same font but it has different weights, in other
cases it might two completely different fonts.

```jsx
export default createGlobalStyle`
    @font-face {
        font-family: 'Work Sans';
        src: local('Work Sans'), local('WorkSans'),
        url(${WorkSansMediumTTF}) format('ttf'),
        url(${WorkSansMediumTTF}) format('ttf');
        font-weight: 500;
        font-style: normal;
    }
    @font-face {
        font-family: 'Work Sans';
        src: local('Work Sans'), local('WorkSans'),
        url(${WorkSansBoldTTF}) format('ttf'),
        url(${WorkSansBoldTTF}) format('ttf');
        font-weight: 700;
        font-style: normal;
    }
`
```

Now we can import this component and add it to our layout so that we are able to
use these fonts for our text but before let's also create a global styles
component to reset some CSS rules as it's kind of done in a similar way.

```jsx
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components'

export default createGlobalStyle`
 *, :before, :after {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  html {
    font-size: 10px;
  }

  body {
    background: ${props => props.theme.colors.white};
    color: ${props => props.theme.colors.text};
    font-family: 'Work Sans, sans-serif';
    max-width: 100%;
  }
`
```

Finally, let's import those two components and add them to our layout

```jsx
import GlobalFonts from '../fonts'
import GlobalStyles from '../utils/GlobalStyles'

export const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Wrapper padding={{ default: 3, sm: 2, lg: 1 }}>
      <GlobalStyles />
      <GlobalFonts />
      <main>{children}</main>
    </Wrapper>
  )
}
```

### Building Components:

We will not build a whole component library but I am going to build some
components like typography components and one button just to give you a basic
idea of what you can do by combining _styled-components_ and _styled-system_
together.

### **Headings**

I like creating headings in the following way and as you can see we are using
the font sizes from our theme, also we are adding the color and space utilities
to be able to change colors or add paddings and margins easily

```jsx
import { color, space } from 'styled-system'

export const H1 = styled.h1`
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.extraLarge};
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;
  ${color};
  ${space};
`

export const H2 = styled.h2`
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.larger};
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;
  ${color};
  ${space};
`

export const H3 = styled.h3`
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.large};
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;
  ${color};
  ${space};
`

export const Subtitle = styled.h4`
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.large};
  font-weight: 500;
  ${color};
  ${space};
`
```

Using the components after is fairly simple I am adding a margin bottom here
just to separate them or display them in a better way and also to give you an
idea of what props you can use with those components.

```jsx
<H1 mb={2} color="dark">
  Hello World
</H1>
<H2 mb={2} color="dark">
  Hello World
</H2>
<H3 mb={2} color="dark">
	Hello World
</H3>
<Subtitle mb={2} color="dark">
  Hello World
</Subtitle>
```

![Headings Components](/images/building-a-design-system/headings.png)

### **Text:**

If you take a look at the Figma (style guide page ⇒ type scale frame). We have
three ways of displaying paragraphs we will manage to merge those three
components in one and here is how:

let's add all of the utilities for the properties that change, most of it is
typography related but I will also add the color and space utilities too!

```jsx
export const Text = styled.p`
  ${typography};
  ${color};
  ${space};
`
```

By using the right props and giving them the right values from our theme (for
example `fontSize="medium"` will resolve to `16px` from our theme) we are able
to represent all of our paragraphs using one component like so:

```jsx
<Text mb={2} fontSize="medium" fontWeight={500} lineHeight="140%">
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
</Text>
<Text mb={2} fontSize="medium" fontWeight={700} lineHeight="140%">
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
</Text>
<Text mb={2} fontSize="small" fontWeight={500} lineHeight="140%">
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
  industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
</Text>
```

![Typography Components](/images/building-a-design-system/typography.png)

### **Others**

The other typography components are stuff like `PreTitle` and `Link` and for
those I use a `<span>` element for you can also combine the two in one if you
want but I like having them this way

```jsx
export const PreTitle = styled.span`
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.extraSmall};
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: ${theme.colors.text};
  letter-spacing: 0.03em;
  display: inline-block;
  ${space};
`

export const LinkText = styled.span`
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.medium};
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: ${props => props.theme.colors.secondary};
  letter-spacing: 0.03em;
  display: inline-block;
  ${space};
`
```

```jsx
<PreTitle mr={2}>Pre Title</PreTitle>
<LinkText ml={2}>Link Text</LinkText>
```

**Note**: I have not created a button text component and instead I will set
those rules next when building the `Button` component

### **Buttons**

When creating a button there is so much to think about like hover effects,
outline, sizes, and more for keeping it simple we will just handle the text of
the button and we will also introduce **variants**

First, let's add the styles for the button's text by following the Figma guide
and when done it should look like this:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const Button = styled.button`
  padding: ${props =>
    `${props.theme.spaces.small} ${props.theme.spaces.medium}`};
  border-radius: 8px;
  font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: ${props => props.theme.fontSizes.medium};
  text-transform: uppercase;
  color: ${props => props.theme.colors.dark};
  letter-spacing: 0.03em;
  display: inline-block;
`
```

Next, is styling the look of our button and if you take a look at the Figma
design in the components page ⇒ forms frame, we have three or four buttons but
what we will not create three or four separate buttons in our code, nor that we
will use lots of props and conditions as that is going to be a bit of a hassle.

We will use one feature from _Styled System_ that is called
[variants](https://styled-system.com/variants) I am sure you know what the term
variant means especially with buttons, what styled system variants allow us to
do is to apply complex styles to a component using a single prop.

For example, we have three buttons one is primary, one is secondary and a
tertiary one, we will pass one of these to our `variant` prop, and based on that
we will render the right styles.

```jsx
import { variant } from "styled-system";

export const Button = styled.button`
	....
	${variant({
	    variants: {
	      primary: {
	        color: "white",
	        bg: "secondary",
	        border: "none",
	        boxShadow:
	          "0px 6px 2px -4px rgba(14, 14, 44, 0.1), inset 0px -1px 0px rgba(14, 14, 44, 0.4)",
	      },
	      secondary: {
	        color: "secondary",
	        bg: "accent",
	        border: "none",
	        boxShadow: "inset 0px -1px 0.5px rgba(14, 14, 44, 0.4)",
	      },
	      tertiary: {
	        color: "secondary",
	        bg: "white",
	        border: `1px solid #ECF1F4`,
	      },
	    },
  })};
```

We start by importing the `variant` function from styled-system and pass our
variants to it by adding the property name then defining styles for it.

**Note**: When defining variants inline, you can use _Styled System_ like syntax
to pick up values from your theme.

And now we are able to use the variant prop in our `Button` component.

```jsx
<Button variant="primary" onClick={() => console.log("clicked!😀")}>
  Button
</Button>
<Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => console.log("clicked!😀")}>
  Button
</Button>
<Button variant="tertiary" onClick={() => console.log("clicked!😀")}>
  Button
</Button>
```

### Conclusion:

- Design systems are used in almost every app and are crucial for having a
  consistent front end
- There are many ways of how to approach a design system in code
- Styled Components along with Styled System are powerful and friendly tools to
  build design systems

This was a basic guide to get you started with building design systems and there
is more stuff that could be discovered so I encourage you to search more about
tools that can help you and your team, one tool I would recommend is
**[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** it is such a great way to display and
document your components and really helpful if you are working with a designer
so check it out. In the end, I hope you've learned a few things from this guide
and are able to write some code in a better way than before, thanks for reading
my article.
